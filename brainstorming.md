The mobile app also has functionalities such as notifications for session bookings and changes.
   - **Story:** The app serves students and learners seeking to connect with like-minded peers for collaborative study and knowledge sharing.

   - **Habit:** EduMatch offers the potential for habitual usage with pushed notifications, as it encourages frequent collaboration and interaction between users. Students and learners are likely to open and use the app regularly to create collaborative learning experiences with their peers.
   - **Scope:** V1 of EduMatch would focus on connecting/matching learners of all ages with the same educational goals (subjects, levels, etc.), facilitating collaborative study groups, and providing tools for communication and collaboration. This could be tested with a network of users.V2 would incorporate real-time messaging among students and a way for students to see their performance. V3 would add a way for students to earn and obtain rewards for goals met.


2. LifePlanner
   - **Mobile:** Incorporates features such as a calendar, to-do list, habit tracking, and meal planning, which are naturally suited for mobile devices. The app might additionally use location data to recommend nearby restaurant options, enhancing the mobile experience. It effectively utilizes sensors (e.g., pedometer for tracking steps) and real-time capabilities for habit and goal tracking.
   - **Story:** Addresses the universal need for effective lifestyle organization and improvement. The value of this app is clear to its audience, which includes individuals looking to manage their time, health, and personal goals more effectively.

Individuals can both consume the app's features and create content by inputting their goals and plans. The app encourages habitual usage with pushed notifications, which will be implemented. It will also use a recommender system for users to form groups with like-minded individuals to boost users' likelihood to achieve their goals.
   - **Scope:** V1 would focus on a calendar and to-do list management. V2 would include goal tracking and habit formation on an individual basis. The technical challenge of building this app with these versions involves database management, user interfaces, and goal tracking. V3 would add a way for users to get recommended restaurants and add other users near them as friends using collaborative filtering.
