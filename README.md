## Overview

### Description

This is an all-in-one app designed to help users organize and improve their lifestyle. It features a customizable calendar and to-do list, with the ability to set and track personal goals, habits, and fitness routines. Users can also input and track their daily nutrition and meal plans. The app could provide insights and recommendations based on user data to help individuals make healthier lifestyle choices.

### App Evaluation

- **Category:** Lifestyle
- **Mobile:** Incorporates features such as a calendar, to-do list, habit tracking, and meal planning, which are naturally suited for mobile devices. The app might additionally use location data to recommend nearby restaurant options, enhancing the mobile experience. It effectively utilizes sensors (e.g., pedometer for tracking steps) and real-time capabilities for habit and goal tracking.
- **Story:** Addresses the universal need for effective lifestyle organization and improvement. The value of this app is clear to its audience, which includes individuals looking to manage their time, health, and personal goals more effectively. 
- **Market:** The app also targets an audience of individuals interested in lifestyle improvement, time management, and health tracking. The potential user base includes individuals from various age groups and backgrounds. The app also caters to niche groups looking for specialized lifestyle management tools.
- **Habit:** The habit-forming potential of LifePlanner is high. Users are likely to open and use the app frequently, as it assists with daily tasks, goal tracking, and habit formation. Individuals can both consume the app's features and create content by inputting their goals and plans. The app encourages habitual usage with pushed notifications, which will be implemented. It will also use a recommender system for users to form groups with like-minded individuals to boost users' likelihood to achieve their goals.
- **Scope:** V1 would focus on a calendar and to-do list management. V2 would include goal tracking and habit formation on an individual basis. The technical challenge of building this app with these versions involves database management, user interfaces, and goal tracking. V3 would add a way for users to get recommended restaurants and add other users near them as friends using collaborative filtering.
